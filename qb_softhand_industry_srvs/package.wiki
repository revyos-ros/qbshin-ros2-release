<<PackageHeader(qb_device_srvs)>>

Each ''qbrobotics®'' device-independent custom ROS service is documented directly in its `.srv` specification and it is designed to fit the Communication Handler requirements (cf. [[qb_device_driver]]). We recommend not to use these services for other purposes outside the ''qbrobotics®'' ecosystem.
